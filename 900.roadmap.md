## RoadMap
  - More testing
  - ~~Configuration file to store various settings~~ DONE! (Initial Approach Sorucing)
  - Additional documentation.
  - Refactoring to make support for different browsers easier to impliment
  - If we stick to writing files to disk - maybe look at using srm to securly remove files after the sesssion has ended.
  - If this project grows, it may get shifted to a regular github repository to make pulls, issue reporting etc easier.
  - ~~Have an option to start a non-private browser window~~ DONE!
  - Ask if you want to auto-update spb via cron (or some other meathod). 
    - Cron is probably the most cross platform appraoch and is all configurable within user-space.
    - Consider detecting tty and exiting with error if the tty is not interactive and the SPB_SKIP_OVERWRITE_CHECK varible not set

## Template User Settings
  - ~~Setup a system which allows a directory of templates to be used~~ DONE!
    - Such a templating system would allow customised settings to be enabled when starting an spb instance
    - A templating system would also allow for pre-configured (and bundled within SPB) configurations to be hardended and ready for use by people who are seeking an out of the box set of tempalte setting options.

## SandBoxing 
  - FileSystem User NameSpaces
     - Restricting Access (eg FireJail etc..) Detroyed on exit.

## Possible Features
  - An option to store the directory in memory rather than on disk at all?
  - An option to disable cache being written to disk :
    -  --disk-cache-dir=
    -  --disk-cache-dir="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/this-instance-cache"
    -  --disable-application-cache --media-cache-size=1 --disk-cache-size=1
