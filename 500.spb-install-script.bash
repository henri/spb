# Simple build script to install 
# the start-private-browser.bash
# and setup an alias within your
# shell - automatical styles !!!
#
# This script downloads spb files from this URL : 
# https://github.com/henri/spb
# 
# Once this script has successfully exectued, start a private browser with this command : 
# ~/bin/start-private-browser.bash
# 
# Initial release only supports zsh, fish and bash shell alias printing.
# Pull requests for other shell alias support bug fixes / reports welcome.
# Additional shells and further automation support will be added as time permits.
# 
# version 1.0 - Initial Release
# version 1.1 - Added BASH shell alias setup output
# version 1.2 - Shallow clone (seems like a good idea)
# version 1.3 - Improved output somewhat specific to insalled shells displayed
# version 1.4 - Implimented additional error detection prior to temporary build directory deletion 
# version 1.5 - Added enviroment variable to skip file overwriting (useful for automated upgrades)
# version 1.6 - Minor bug fix
# version 1.7 - Added ZSH shell alias setup output
# version 1.8 - Basic version reporting added
# version 1.9 - Implimented additional error checking and handling of unexpected conditions
