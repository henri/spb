# Browser Specific Notes

---

<b>NOTES :</b>
  - This page needs some love your input is apprecated.
  - Currently SPB simply makes setting up your prfered browser switches easier.

---

## Brave 

---
  - internal URLs
    - <b>```brave://components``` (update Brave components)</b>
    - ```about://discards``` (view / manually unload processes)
  - command line switches
    - --disable-background-networking
      - prevents subsystems typically perform activities like automatic connections to services, online certificate updates, network predictions, and analytics when you are not actively browsing
  - keyboard shortcuts
     - shift-esc (show browser task manager)

## FireFox

---
  - internal URLs
    - ```about:processes``` (view FireFox processes)</b>

### Example of combining flags to use with chromium

```
# simply add and remove falgs as required
#
# if you are using spb with a single browser you may simply
# add flags to your spb fish alias to have these flags
# applied for all spb sessions started via your spb alias
#
# keep in mind that not all chromium dirvied browsers will respect all flags
# also, these flags often change over time. the list below may be outdated.

chromium-browser --disable-background-networking --disable-breakpad --disable-cloud-import --disable-databases --disable-preconnect --disable-speech-api --disable-sync --disable-voice-input --disable-webgl --incognito --media-cache-dir=/dev/null --disk-cache-dir=/dev/null --no-pings --no-wifi --disable-local-storage 
```

### potentially useful flags with explanation

<b>--disable-background-networking</b>

this switch disables several subsystems which run network requests in the background helpful when carryiong out network performance testing to avoid noise in the measurements. (may interfere with normal browser function)

<b>--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages</b> 

disables default component extensions with background pages useful for performance tests where these pages may interfere with performance results (may interfere with normal browser function)

<b>--dns-prefetch-disable</b>

disables prefetching of DNS information and may reduce unwanted network traffic (potential for performance issues)
